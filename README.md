## Brief Description
A number of tools exist for identifying repeat features, but it remains a problem that the DNA sequence of some genes can be identified as being a repeat sequence. If such sequences are used to mask the genome, genes may be missed in the downstream annotation. Assuming that gene sequences have various signatures relating to their function and that repeats have different signatures including the repetitive nature of the signal itself, we want to train a classifier to separate the repeat sequences from the gene sequences. We are inspired by DETR, an object detection model, this proposal will use transformer structure to complete the identify repeat sequence task, our model will unify segmentation and classification into one like the object detection model.
## Network architecture
![](fig/DETRmodel.png)
The input of the model is subsequence, and the output will be `where` and `type` of each subsequence. More data meaning can be found in [the visualization in the model](#the-visualization-in-the-model) 
## Requirements:
1. A machine with atleast **8GB of RAM** (although **16-32GB** is recommended. A single GPU machine would suffice. The model can be trained on CPU as well but will be a lot faster if trained on a GPU.<br/><br/>
2. A stable Internet Connection.<br/><br/>
3. Set up a development environment with [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry):
```shell
pyenv install 3.9.12

pyenv virtualenv 3.9.12 repeat_identification

poetry install
```

 ## Data Preparation:
The model uses fasta and its paired annotation to make predictions. <br/>
**Download And Generate Required Files:**

Download a genome assembly, initially the human reference genome `GRCh38` (called hg38 by Dfam), from the UCSC Genome Browser.

Download repeat annotations from [Dfam](https://www.dfam.org/home) and generate a subset of the annotations by selecting the desired repeat family or subtype. The selected annotations are saved as the repeat boundaries to create the sequence segmentation dataset.

In order to download and generate needed files should run:
```shell
python generate_dataset.py --species
```
If you use human genome run like: `python generate_dataset.py --species hg38 --configuration configuration.yaml`<br/>
All of the option can add personalized configuration by `configuration.yaml`

And the generated files will seperate by chromosome, and the generated file will looks like:
```shell
>data
>>genome_assemblies
>>>hg38.fa
>>>hg38.fa.gz
>>>datasets
chr1.fa
chr1.fa.fai
…………
>>annotations
hg38_chr10.pickle
>>>
hg38.hits
hg38.hits.gz
hg38_chr14.csv
hg38_chr7.csv 
…………
repeat_families.json
```

<br/>


**Configuration Parameter:**<br/>
Some configuration should be defined in this stage.
```shell
# experiment files directory
save_directory: experiments

# experiment naming prefix
experiment_prefix: standard
################################################################################

# dataset
################################################################################
chromosomes: ['chr1']

```
Additionally, the length of subsequence can be defined by user, but it would not large than 4000.
<br/>

## Train the Model:
 You are gonna train your own model in `model.py` script..<br/>
To train the model, run:<br/>
```shell
python train.py --configuration configuration.yaml
```

Additionally, some configuration should be defined in this stage.

## The visualization in the model:

Visualizing the predictions of the network will help us understand them better and debug and finetune the model. <br/>
During testing, for a raw sequence we have its repeat annotation:
<br/>
```shell
raw sequence: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA'CATTCATGCATGC'TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA

raw sequence: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA'cattcatgcatgc'TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA

annotation(ground truth): AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```
The trained model should get the raw sequence as input, excluding the repeat annotation:
```shell
raw sequence: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA'CATTCATGCATGC'TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```
And then we would get sample predictions, compared to the ground truth:
```shell
ground truth: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
  prediction: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA'CATTCATGCATGC'TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```
Wrong prediction, the model didn't find any repeats:
```shell
ground truth: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
  prediction: AG🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉'CATTCATGCATGC'TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```
Wrong prediction, the model predicted a repeat of a different type in a different location:
```shell
ground truth: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
  prediction: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA'CATTCA'🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```
This is the perfect prediction👇:
```shell
ground truth: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
  prediction: AGAACCTATTATTTGCATGA🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑🥑TAGAAGAAACCTGTATTTTTTTCATCA
```


<br/>
## Further step
As the DETR model did not learn so much, and the model is so complicated，it is hard to debug, so we also provide the alternative way to identity repeat region, in here the transformer model is used, due to time limit, there is no much results here. This project is still under development.<br/>
**Alternative model architecture**
![](fig/newnetwork.gif)

This model is simple than DETR, but it also can get the repeat region and it have the same input as DETR. The visualized output will looks like:
```shell
ground truth:AGAACCTATT🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓TAGAAGAAA🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓ATCAG
  prediction:**********🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓*********🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓*****
```
Each '*' represent the base is not repeat region, each '🍓' represent the repeat region include its type.
**Important note:**
The validation loss value is being calculated erroneously. The label is wrongly feeded into the validation stage, this is
what we should avoid, I will continue fixing it.
